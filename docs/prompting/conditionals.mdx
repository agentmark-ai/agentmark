title: Conditionals
description: Conditionals allow you to create dynamic prompts that adapt based on props or other conditions.
---

Use the `<If>`, `<ElseIf>`, and `<Else>` tags for conditional rendering:

```jsx example.prompt.mdx
---
name: greeting
metadata:
  model:
    name: gpt-4
test_settings:
  props:
    userType: "admin"
---

<System>
  <If condition={props.userType == "admin"}>
    You should provide detailed technical information when asked.
  </If>
  <ElseIf condition={props.userType == "developer"}>
    You should provide code examples when asked.
  </ElseIf>
  <Else>
    You should provide simple explanations.
  </Else>
</System>

<User>Tell me about databases.</User>
```

## Logical Operators

You can use standard JavaScript logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) in your conditions:

```jsx example.prompt.mdx
---
name: language-response
metadata:
  model:
    name: gpt-4
test_settings:
  props:
    isAdmin: true
    hasTechnicalBackground: true
---

<System>
  <If condition={props.isAdmin && props.hasTechnicalBackground}>
    Include implementation details and system architecture in your responses.
  </If>
  <ElseIf condition={props.isAdmin || props.hasTechnicalBackground}>
    Include technical details but avoid implementation specifics.
  </ElseIf>
  <Else>
    Keep explanations simple and non-technical.
  </Else>
</System>
```

## Nested Conditionals

Conditionals can be nested for more complex logic:

```jsx example.prompt.mdx
---
name: nested-conditions
metadata:
  model:
    name: gpt-4
test_settings:
  props:
    userLevel: "expert"
    language: "Spanish"
---

<System>
  <If condition={props.userLevel == "expert"}>
    <If condition={props.language == "Spanish"}>
      Respond with technical Spanish and include English translations.
    </If>
    <Else>
      Respond with technical English.
    </Else>
  </If>
  <Else>
    <If condition={props.language == "Spanish"}>
      Respond with simple Spanish and include English translations.
    </If>
    <Else>
      Respond with simple English.
    </Else>
  </If>
</System>
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep conditions simple and readable
2. Use meaningful variable names in conditions
3. Consider breaking complex conditional logic into separate components
4. Test different condition branches using test_settings
