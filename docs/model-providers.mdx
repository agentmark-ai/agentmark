description: Learn how to add model providers to your AgentMark project.

AgentMark doesn't provide any models by default. Instead, each model must be added as a plugin. We provide the ability to add our own
built-in plugins, or custom plugins.

## Provided Plugins

This is the list of model plugins provided/supported by AgentMark.

## Adding Model Plugins

Adding model plugins is a straight-forward process.

### Adding All latest

Adding all latest models isn't recommended for production because you'll likely only need a subset of models for your app. Also, it's important to pin models
so outputs don't change unexpectedly with new versions.

```tsx
import AllModelPlugins from '@puzzlet/all-models';
ModelPluginRegistry.registerAll(AllModelPlugins);
```

### Adding Individual Model Plugins

Selectively adding models allows you to choose which providers you support, and pin model versions.

Example: Adding OpenAI models
```tsx
import OpenAIChatPlugin from "@puzzlet/openai";
import { ModelPluginRegistry } from "@puzzlet/agentmark";

ModelPluginRegistry.register(new OpenAIChatPlugin(), ['gpt-4o']);
```

## Using your model plugins

Once your plugin is registered, you can use it within your agentmark files. Here, we are using gpt-4o.

```jsx example.prompt.mdx
---
name: basic-prompt
metadata:
  model:
    name: gpt-4o
---

<User>Hello World</User>
```

## Creating Custom Model Plugins

We support adding your own custom plugins. Documentation coming soon.
