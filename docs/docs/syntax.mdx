# Syntax

A PromptDX file has two primary components to it.
1. **Frontmatter**
2. **Body**

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is defined in yaml, and its where your configuration and metadata about your prompts are stored. 
In there, you will find:

1. Model Configuration
2. A required name for your prompt
3. Any test related data (i.e. test props, etc.)
4. Any other metadata you want to define like version, author, etc.

## Body

The body of your prompt corresponds to the messages being sent to the LLM.
