# What is PromptDX?

PromptDX is a declarative, extensible, and composable approach for developing LLM prompts using Markdown and JSX. 
With PromptDX, you can easily open a file to see the exact input sent to the LLM.

PromptDX is built on top of our templating language [TemplateDX](https://github.com/puzzlet-ai/templatedx).
