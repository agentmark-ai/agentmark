# What is AgentMark?

AgentMark is a declarative, extensible, and composable approach for developing LLM agents or prompts using readable Markdown and JSX. 
With AgentMark, you can easily open a file to see the exact input sent to the LLM.

AgentMark is built on top of our templating language [TemplateDX](https://github.com/puzzlet-ai/templatedx).

## Motivation

The goal of AgentMark is to simplify the development of agents. We do this by:

- Supporting readable/portable Markdown + JSX.
- Decoupling your prompts from code
- Decoupling your model providers through a unified interface
- Keeping everything local with our OSS runtime

## Why extend Markdown?

AgentMark is built on TemplateDX, which extends Markdown's familiar syntax to support complex, structured content needs. 
Markdown works well for basic content but lacks the flexibility needed for templating, composable components, 
and organized content. TemplateDX introduces custom components and templating capabilities, enabling document composability, 
conditional rendering, and variable interpolation while maintaining Markdownâ€™s readability and simplicity. 
This approach offers a powerful tool for creating dynamic, content-rich documents.

## Supported Languages

Currently we support TypeScript. We have plans to support additional languages in the near future.
