AgentMark is a declarative, extensible, and composable approach for developing LLM applications using Markdown and JSX. AgentMark files enhance readability by displaying the readable inputs sent to the LLM, while providing lightweight abstractions for developers.


## Motivation

The goal of AgentMark is to simplify the development of agents. We do this by:

- Supporting readable/portable Markdown + JSX.
- Decoupling your prompts from code
- Decoupling your model config through a unified interface
- Keeping everything local with our OSS runtime

## Why extend Markdown?

Markdown works well for basic content but lacks the flexibility needed for templating, composable components, 
and organized content. AgentMark is built on TemplateDX, which introduces custom components and templating capabilities, enabling document composability, 
conditional rendering, and variable interpolation while maintaining Markdown's readability and simplicity. 
This approach offers a powerful tool for creating dynamic, content-rich documents.
