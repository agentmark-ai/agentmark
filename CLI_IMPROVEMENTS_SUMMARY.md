# AgentMark CLI Dataset Output Improvements - Final Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements made to the AgentMark CLI to address dataset output issues, including cell truncation, AI execution, media handling, and user experience enhancements.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Cell Truncation (‚úÖ Fixed)
**Problem**: Dataset output content was being truncated with "..." when it exceeded character limits.
**Solution**: Removed fixed truncation logic and enabled `wordWrap: true` for vertical expansion.

### 2. No AI Execution (‚úÖ Fixed)
**Problem**: CLI was only formatting prompts but not running them through actual AI models.
**Solution**: Complete rewrite with `ai` v4.0.0 library integration for real AI generation.

### 3. Poor Media Handling (‚úÖ Fixed)
**Problem**: Terminal couldn't display images/audio effectively.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive web-based viewer with beautiful HTML templates.

### 4. Inconsistent Output Format (‚úÖ Fixed)
**Problem**: Image/audio datasets used different format than text/object datasets.
**Solution**: Unified all dataset types to use consistent table format with streaming.

### 5. **File Path Visibility Issues (‚úÖ Fixed)**
**Problem**: File paths were truncated in table cells and couldn't be accessed.
**Solution**: 
- Print file paths outside table for full visibility
- Added `printFilePath()` function with clear copy-paste instructions
- Format: `Entry X images/audio:` followed by full file path

### 6. **No Streaming Indicators (‚úÖ Fixed)**  
**Problem**: Users had no indication that dataset processing had started.
**Solution**: Added `üîÑ Processing dataset entries...` message before first result appears.

### 7. **Missing Error Handling (‚úÖ Fixed)**
**Problem**: Invalid API keys in single props mode never showed errors in terminal.
**Solution**: Wrapped all AI generation calls in try-catch blocks with specific API key error detection.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `packages/cli/package.json` - Added `ai` v4.0.0 dependency
- `packages/cli/src/commands/run-prompt.ts` - Complete execution system rewrite
- `packages/cli/src/utils/web-viewer.ts` - Cross-platform media viewer utilities

### Key Functions Added
- `printFilePath()` - Prints file paths outside tables for full visibility
- Real-time streaming for all dataset types
- Comprehensive error handling for all prompt types
- Try-catch blocks with specific API key error messages

### Current User Experience

#### Dataset Execution Flow
1. **Start Indicator**: Shows `üîÑ Processing dataset entries...`
2. **Table Header**: Prints immediately when processing begins  
3. **Real-time Streaming**: Each row appears as AI generation completes
4. **File Path Display**: For image/audio, full paths printed outside table:
   ```
   Entry 1 images:
   üìÇ Path: /tmp/agentmark-images-abc123.html
   üí° Copy and paste this path into your browser address bar
   ```
5. **Table Footer**: Prints when all entries complete

#### Error Handling
- **Dataset errors**: Show in table row with ‚ùå indicator
- **API key errors**: Clear message with troubleshooting hint
- **Single props errors**: Immediate terminal feedback

#### File Access
- **No browser spam**: Files created but not auto-opened
- **Universal compatibility**: Copy-paste paths work in all terminals/OS
- **Clear instructions**: Explicit guidance for file access

## Features Delivered

‚úÖ **Streaming Results**: Real-time feedback as each dataset entry completes  
‚úÖ **Full File Paths**: Complete paths visible outside truncated table cells  
‚úÖ **Error Visibility**: API key and generation errors clearly displayed  
‚úÖ **Processing Indicators**: Users know when dataset processing has started  
‚úÖ **Universal File Access**: Copy-paste file paths work everywhere  
‚úÖ **Professional Media Viewer**: Beautiful HTML templates for images/audio  
‚úÖ **Consistent Format**: All dataset types use same table structure  
‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux  

## Final Status

The AgentMark CLI has been transformed from a basic formatting tool into a complete AI execution environment with:

- **Professional UX**: Real-time streaming with clear progress indicators
- **Universal Media Access**: File paths that work in any terminal/browser
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear feedback for API and generation issues  
- **Consistent Interface**: Unified experience across all prompt types
- **Cross-platform Support**: Reliable operation on all major operating systems
