### 🩹 Fixes

- Fix pydantic-ai-v0 webhook crash and eliminate __version__ drift across all Python packages. ([#559](https://github.com/agentmark-ai/agentmark/pull/559))

  **Pydantic webhook fix:** Restore `commit_sha` parameter threading across `run_experiment`, `_stream_experiment`, `_stream_text_experiment`, and `_stream_object_experiment` in `pydantic-ai-v0-adapter/webhook.py`. This un-breaks the `dataset-run` webhook path on main, which has been crashing with `TypeError: run_experiment() takes 5 positional arguments but 6 were given` since the server.py dispatcher was updated to forward `commitSha` without the matching handler update. The matching fix from Ryan's branch commit `3a1184cb` was silently reverted during a merge conflict resolution before PR #1754 merged.

  **Version drift fix:** Replace hardcoded `__version__ = "..."` strings in all Python package `__init__.py` files with dynamic lookups via `importlib.metadata.version(...)`. Previously, 4 of 5 packages had `__init__.py` versions that didn't match their `pyproject.toml`:

  | Package | pyproject | __init__ (before) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `agentmark-pydantic-ai-v0` | `0.1.1` | `0.1.0` |
  | `agentmark-claude-agent-sdk-v0` | `0.1.1` | `0.0.0` |
  | `agentmark-prompt-core` | `0.0.1` | `0.1.0` (ahead) |
  | `agentmark-sdk` | `0.0.1` | `0.1.0` (ahead) |
  | `agentmark-templatedx` | `0.0.1` | `0.1.0` (ahead) |

  The durable fix reads the version from installed dist metadata at import time via `importlib.metadata.version(...)`, so runtime `module.__version__` always exactly matches what `pip` / `uv pip show` reports. Drift becomes impossible at the source level. If the package isn't installed (e.g., running from source without `uv sync`), the import will raise `PackageNotFoundError` immediately — a loud failure is strictly preferable to a silent sentinel that masks install issues and misleads compatibility gates.

  **CLI OTLP decoder fix:** Declare `@opentelemetry/otlp-transformer` as a direct dependency of `@agentmark-ai/cli`. The CLI's `api-server.ts:446` calls `require("@opentelemetry/otlp-transformer/build/src/generated/root")` to decode incoming OTLP protobuf span batches at `POST /v1/traces`, but the package was never declared in `cli/package.json` — it only resolved in monorepo dev because `@mastra/core` transitively hoists it to root `node_modules/`. On `npx @agentmark-ai/cli` installs, that transitive chain doesn't exist, so every protobuf span batch crashed the `require()` at runtime and was silently returned as `HTTP 400: Failed to decode protobuf: Cannot find module ...`. This affected every span source using the OTLP protobuf protocol (experiments, dataset runs, any `init_tracing()`-enabled client) — spans were ingested by the request but dropped at the decoder. Adding the dep with `^0.203.0` (matching the version `@mastra/core` transitively resolves) fixes the crash without changing the decoder logic itself. A longer-term refactor to own the OTLP schema is possible but deferred — the current `require()` path has been stable across otlp-transformer versions and the minimal-change fix is the right call.

  **model-registry bump:** Patch bump to keep the model-registry release cadence aligned with the CLI, which transitively consumes it.

## 0.2.1 (2026-04-08)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Republish with the compiled `dist/` output. The previously published `0.2.0` tarball shipped only `src/index.ts` and had `main: "src/index.ts"` in its manifest, so consumers running on Node ≥22.6 hit `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING` because Node refuses to type-strip TypeScript files inside `node_modules`. The package source was corrected in a later sync but never republished. This release contains `dist/index.js` (CJS) plus `dist/index.d.ts` and a manifest pointing at the compiled entry, so consumers like `@agentmark-ai/cli` work on modern Node again.

## 0.2.0 (2026-02-13)

### 🚀 Features

- Move model-registry to OSS as @agentmark-ai/model-registry, update CLI to use import syntax ([#471](https://github.com/agentmark-ai/agentmark/pull/471))
